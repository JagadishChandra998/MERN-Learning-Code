Your DSA Presentation website is now production-ready!

## Build Output

- **Total Size**: ~426 KB (gzipped: ~134 KB)
- **Optimized**: Code-split, minified, and compressed

## Files to Upload

Upload the entire contents of the `dist/` folder to your web server root directory:

```
dist/
  ├── index.html
  ├── assets/
  │   ├── index-B_QCBGFj.css
  │   ├── react-vendor-BzrpNAyj.js
  │   ├── prism-D6a4iLhX.js
  │   ├── animation-8b2MkDpl.js
  │   └── index-Bx_ebcs-.js
  └── vite.svg
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Upload Files
- Connect to your hosting via FTP/SFTP or cPanel File Manager
- Navigate to your website root (usually `public_html/` or `www/`)
- Upload ALL files from the `dist/` folder

### 2. Upload .htaccess
- Upload the `.htaccess` file from the project root to the same directory as index.html

  - React Router (SPA routing)
  - Caching headers for optimal performance
  - Gzip compression
  - MIME types

### 3. Verify Upload
Ensure these files are in your web root:
```
public_html/
  ├── index.html

  └── vite.svg
```
